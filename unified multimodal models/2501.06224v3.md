## 摘要

Recently, violence detection systems developed using unified multimodal
models have achieved significant success and attracted widespread attention.
However, most of these systems face two critical challenges: the lack of
interpretability as black-box models and limited functionality, offering only
classification or retrieval capabilities. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the
Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and
graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities:
detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each
video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model
(LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to
generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses
GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video
embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for
multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to
verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper
introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of
the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on
the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the
proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the
number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to
decrease.
