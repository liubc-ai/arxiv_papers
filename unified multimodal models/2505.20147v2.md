## 摘要

The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the
emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual
understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most
existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent
limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image
generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In
this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing
FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as
an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced
probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond
the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement
with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration
during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we
initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to
the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both
visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as
a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we
show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant
performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement
through reinforcement learning.
